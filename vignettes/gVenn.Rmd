# Introduction

The gVenn package provides tools to compute overlaps between genomic region sets and visualize them as proportional Venn diagrams. It is especially useful in genomic analyses involving ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, or other region-based datasets.

# Example workflow

## Create example GRanges

We create three synthetic genomic regions on chromosome 1:

```{r example-data}
set.seed(42)

gr1 <- GenomicRanges::GRanges("chr1", IRanges::IRanges(start = sample(1:1e6, 100), width = 200))
gr2 <- GenomicRanges::GRanges("chr1", IRanges::IRanges(start = sample(1:1e6, 100), width = 200))
gr3 <- GenomicRanges::GRanges("chr1", IRanges::IRanges(start = sample(1:1e6, 100), width = 200))

regions <- list(A = gr1, B = gr2, C = gr3)
```

## Compute Overlaps

We compute the overlaps using `computeOverlaps()`

```{r compute-overlaps}
genomic_overlaps <- computeOverlaps(regions)
```

The result is a list containing:
- A GRanges object with metadata describing overlaps.
- A count matrix or data frame used for visualization.

## Proportional Venn Diagram

We use `plotVenn()` to visualize the overlaps:

```{r plot-venn}
plotVenn(genomic_overlaps)
```

## UpSet Plot (Optional)

If overlaps are complex, `plotUpset()` may be preferable:

```{r plot-upset}
plotUpSet(genomic_overlaps)
```

## Export visualization

You can export any plot using `saveViz()`:

```{r save-plot, eval=FALSE}
venn <- plotVenn(genomic_overlaps)
saveViz(venn, filename = "venn_diagram", format = "pdf")
```

# Conclusion

gVenn provides a user-friendly and accurate way to visualize and quantify overlaps between genomic datasets. It supports proportional areas for intuitive comparison and integrates smoothly into Bioconductor workflows.
