\title{Extract Overlap Groups from Genomic or Set Overlap Results}
\usage{
extractOverlaps(overlap_object)
}
\arguments{
\item{overlap_object}{A \code{GenomicOverlapsResult} or \code{SetOverlapsResult} object.}
}
\value{
A named list of grouped intersecting elements:
\itemize{
\item If input is a \code{GenomicOverlapsResult}, a \code{GRangesList} split by \code{intersect_category}.
\item If input is a \code{SetOverlapsResult}, a named \code{list} of character vectors grouped by \code{intersect_category}.
}
}
\description{
This function extracts subsets of intersecting elements grouped by their overlap category (e.g., "110").
For genomic overlaps, it returns a \code{GRangesList}; for set overlaps, it returns a named list of character vectors.

\examples{
# Example with gene sets (built-in dataset)

# Example with genomic regions (built-in dataset)
data(a549_chipseq_peaks)
res_genomic <- computeOverlaps(a549_chipseq_peaks)
