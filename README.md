**gVenn** stands for **gene/genomic Venn**.  
It provides tools to compute overlaps between sets of gene or genomic
regions and visualize them as Venn diagrams with areas proportional to
the number of overlapping elements. With seamless support for `GRanges`
and `GRangesList` objects, **gVenn** integrates naturally into
Bioconductor workflows such as ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, or other
interval-based analyses, and produces clean, publication-ready figures.

## Installation

You can install the development version of gVenn from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:
