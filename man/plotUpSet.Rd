\title{Plot an UpSet Diagram from Genomic or Set Overlap Results}
\usage{
plotUpSet(overlap_object, customSetOrder = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{overlap_object}{A \code{GenomicOverlapsResult} or \code{SetOverlapsResult} object
returned by \code{\link{computeOverlaps}}.}
}
\value{
An UpSet plot object generated by \code{ComplexHeatmap::UpSet}.
}
\description{
This function creates an UpSet plot using the \code{ComplexHeatmap} package to
visualize intersections across multiple sets.
Supports both \code{GenomicOverlapsResult} and \code{SetOverlapsResult} objects.
}
\examples{
# Example with gene sets (built-in dataset)
data(gene_list)
res_sets <- computeOverlaps(gene_list)
plotUpSet(res_sets)

# Example with genomic regions (built-in dataset)
data(a549_chipseq_peaks)
res_genomic <- computeOverlaps(a549_chipseq_peaks)
plotUpSet(res_genomic)
}
