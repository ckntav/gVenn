\title{Compute Overlaps Between Named Sets}
\usage{
compute_set_overlaps(named_sets)
}
\arguments{
\item{named_sets}{A named list of character vectors, where each vector contains identifiers (e.g., gene symbols) belonging to a set.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{SetOverlapsResult}, a list with the following components:
\describe{
\item{unique_elements}{A character vector of all unique elements across the input sets.}
\item{overlap_matrix}{A logical matrix indicating for each element (rows) whether it is present in each set (columns).}
\item{intersect_category}{A character vector encoding the pattern of overlaps per element (e.g., "110", "101").}
}
}
\description{
This function computes overlaps across a list of character vectors (e.g., gene symbols, transcript IDs, region names),
returning a binary matrix of presence/absence and overlap categories per element.
}
\examples{
gene_sets <- list(
  TF1_targets = c("TP53", "BRCA1", "MYC"),
  TF2_targets = c("MYC", "ESR1"),
  TF3_targets = c("TP53", "GATA3")
)

res <- compute_set_overlaps(gene_sets)
head(res$overlap_matrix)
table(res$intersect_category)

# Can be passed to plotVenn() or plotUpset()
plotVenn(res)
