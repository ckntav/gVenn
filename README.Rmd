# gVenn

<!-- badges: start -->

**Proportional Venn and UpSet diagrams for genomic regions and gene set overlaps.**

**gVenn** stands for **gene/genomic Venn**.  
It provides tools to compute overlaps between sets of gene or genomic regions 
and visualize them as Venn diagrams with areas proportional to the number of 
overlapping elements. With seamless support for `GRanges` and `GRangesList` 
objects, **gVenn** integrates naturally into Bioconductor workflows such as 
ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, or other interval-based analyses, and produces clean, 
publication-ready figures.

## Installation

You can install the development version of gVenn from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("ckntav/gVenn")
```

## Quick start

This quick example demonstrates how to compute overlaps between ChIP-seq 
peaks and visualize them with both a Venn diagram and an UpSet plot.

### Load example ChIP-seq data and compute overlaps
```{r, example_ov}
library(gVenn)

# Example dataset of ChIP-seq peaks (A549 cell line, 3 genomic regions)
data(a549_chipseq_peaks)

# Compute overlaps
ov <- computeOverlaps(a549_chipseq_peaks)
```

### Visualize
```{r, example_venn}
# Draw Venn diagram
plotVenn(ov)
```

```{r, example_upset, fig.width=5, fig.height=2.5}
# Draw UpSet plot (useful for larger numbers of sets)
plotUpSet(ov)
```

### Extract elements per overlap group
```{r, extractOverlaps_example}
groups <- extractOverlaps(ov)

# display the number of genomic regions per overlap group
sapply(groups, length)
```
