\title{Plot a Venn Diagram from Genomic or Set Overlap Results}
\usage{
plotVenn(
  overlap_object,
  labels = FALSE,
  legend = "right",
  fill = c("#2B70AB", "#FFB027", "#3EA742", "#CD3301", "#9370DB"),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{overlap_object}{A \code{GenomicOverlapsResult} or \code{SetOverlapsResult} object returned by
\code{\link{computeOverlaps}}.}

\item{labels}{Logical. Whether to show set labels on the diagram. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{legend}{Position of the legend ("right", "top", "bottom", etc.) or \code{FALSE} to disable.}

\item{fill}{A character vector of fill colors for the sets.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{\link[eulerr]{plot.euler}}.}
}
\value{
A Venn diagram plot generated by \code{eulerr}.
}
\description{
This function creates a Venn diagram using the \code{eulerr} package to visualize intersections
across multiple sets (up to ~5). Supports both \code{GenomicOverlapsResult} and \code{SetOverlapsResult} objects.
}
\examples{
# Example with gene sets (built-in dataset)
data(gene_list)
res_sets <- computeOverlaps(gene_list)
plotVenn(res_sets)

# Example with genomic regions (built-in dataset)
data(a549_chipseq_peaks)
res_genomic <- computeOverlaps(a549_chipseq_peaks)
plotVenn(res_genomic)
}
