\title{Count the Number of "1"s in Strings}
\usage{
count_ones(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A character vector where each element is a string
potentially containing \code{"1"} characters.}
}
\value{
An integer vector of the same length as \code{x},
giving the count of \code{"1"} in each string.
}
\description{
This function counts how many times the character \code{"1"} appears
in each element of a character vector. It is mainly used internally
when working with binary category codes (e.g., \code{"101"}, \code{"110"})
that represent overlap patterns across sets.
}
\examples{
count_ones(c("101", "110", "000", "111"))
# Returns: 2 2 0 3
