exportOverlaps(
  grouped,
  output_dir = ".",
  output_file = "overlap_groups",
  with_date = TRUE,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{grouped}{Overlap groups from \code{extractOverlaps()}.}

\item{output_dir}{A string specifying the output directory. Defaults to \code{"."}.}

\item{output_file}{A string specifying the base filename (without extension).
Defaults to \code{"overlap_groups"}.}

\item{with_date}{Logical (default \code{TRUE}). Whether to prepend the current

This function exports the output of \code{extractOverlaps()} to an Excel file,
creating one sheet per overlap group. Genomic overlaps (\code{GRanges}) are
converted to data frames before export.

\examples{
res <- computeOverlaps(list(A = letters[1:3], B = letters[2:4]))
grouped <- extractOverlaps(res)
exportOverlaps(grouped, output_dir = tempdir(), output_file = "overlap_groups.xlsx")
